- Must not block stairs, stair rail, or stair opening.
- Leave vent left of fireplace visible.
- Maintain at least 36" walkway from stairs to sliding door.
- Keep all furniture at least 8" clear of sliding door track.
- Left bay furniture depth must be â‰¤9.75"; right side furniture â‰¤18".

DO NOT:
- Do not apply more than one wall treatment per render.
- Do not cover every wall with paneling or slats.
- Do not use thick grid paneling, shiplap, beadboard, rustic slats, or wainscoting.
- Do not introduce red, orange, cherry, or teak woods. Use mid walnut only.
- Do not use glossy paint, high contrast gallery walls, or heavy clutter.

STYLE_GUARDRAILS = """
SCOPE OF CHANGE:
- Change the wall treatment only. One treatment max.
- Keep at least 40% of the wall surface plain.

MATERIAL UNIFICATION:
- Single wood family: mid walnut - matte. No other wood tones.

OBJECT BUDGET:
- Max 7 styled objects per side (books count as 1 group).
- Max 1 plant per side. No gallery walls. No overlapping frames.

COMPOSITION:
- If shelves are present, use at most 2 floating shelves per side.
- Prefer negative space around art and objects.

CAMERA_PROMPT = """
CAMERA VIEWPOINT:
- Show the back of the grey couch centered in foreground.
- Fireplace wall centered in background.
- Same focal length and vantage as source. No wide angle exaggeration.
- For night scenes: Expose for interior lighting, not exterior â€” windows should read as dark voids.
- For day scenes: Naturalistic interior lighting with accurate exposure.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Accent wall color must EXTEND FULLY into the staircase wall plane (no sharp cutoff).
    - Fireplace bump-out must be the SAME COLOR as the surrounding accent (no white stripe).
    - Armchairs must be brown/tan leather only. Do not render gray or fabric chairs.
    - For night scenes: Exterior must be completely black with no visible sky or light sources.
    - For night scenes: Windows must appear as dark voids with no illumination.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - Left bay depth 9.75in max
    - Right side furniture 18in max depth
    - 55.5in left bay width
    - 55in to staircase on right, 38in to sconce
    - 106in back sofa wall, 168in sliding door wall

    WALL TREATMENT - VARIATION {variation_index + 1}:

    LIGHTING & TIME OF DAY:
    {lighting}

    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - Do not show the projector screen; keep it retracted.
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.
    - Keep wall colors legible at night; avoid crushing shadows or heavy vignettes.
    - For night scenes: Windows must be PURE BLACK â€” no light, no sky, no exterior visibility.
    - For night scenes: Only warm interior lights illuminate the room â€” floor lamp and minimal track lighting.

    FURNITURE PLACEMENT:
    - LEFT SIDE: Floating shelves and console table only
    - RIGHT SIDE: Mirrors and side table only
    - Keep furniture within depth limits (left â‰¤9.75in, right â‰¤18in)

    MATERIAL AND COLOR RULES:
    - Walls: soft warm gray or off-white, matte (unless accent wall specified).
    - Wood: {furniture_color}. Absolutely no red/orange wood.
    - Metals: small brass accents only.

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.
    - Styling should feel airy and uncluttered in both day and night lighting.

    MUST PRESERVE:
    - Existing couch, floors, openings, fireplace, window and door positions.
    - Vent left of fireplace remains visible.
