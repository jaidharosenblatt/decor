        Design Requirements:
        - MUST KEEP: Existing leather couch and current floors (do not change these)
        - Mix warm leathers/wood (tan chairs, walnut cabinets) with cool neutrals (grey elements, white walls)
        - Clean lines and low-slung furniture
        - Curated shelving with objects/art (styled but not cluttered)
        - Rugs that ground the space and add warmth
        - White walls + dark floors = bold backdrop (walls can change color)
        - Break up with warm wood cabinetry, built-ins, or furniture
        - Transitional balance between modern and classic elements
        - Natural light from large sliding glass wall
        - Incorporate existing couch and maintain its placement
        - All other furniture, wall colors, and decor can be changed
