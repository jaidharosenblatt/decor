MATERIAL UNIFICATION:
- Single wood family: mid walnut - matte. No other wood tones.

OBJECT BUDGET:
- Max 7 styled objects per side (books count as 1 group).

COMPOSITION:
- If shelves are present, use at most 2 floating shelves per side.
- Prefer negative space around art and objects.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

    - Accent wall color must EXTEND FULLY into the staircase wall plane (no sharp cutoff).
    - Fireplace bump-out must be the SAME COLOR as the surrounding accent (no white stripe).
    - Armchairs must be brown/tan leather only. Do not render gray or fabric chairs.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - Left bay depth 9.75in max
    - Right side furniture 18in max depth
    - 55.5in left bay width
    - 55in to staircase on right, 38in to sconce

    LIGHTING & TIME OF DAY:

    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - Do not show the projector screen; keep it retracted.
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.
    - Keep wall colors legible at night; avoid crushing shadows or heavy vignettes.

    FURNITURE PLACEMENT:
    - LEFT SIDE: Floating shelves and console table only
    - RIGHT SIDE: Mirrors and side table only
    - Keep furniture within depth limits (left â‰¤9.75in, right â‰¤18in)

    MATERIAL AND COLOR RULES:
    - Walls: soft warm gray or off-white, matte (unless accent wall specified).
    - Wood: {furniture_color}. Absolutely no red/orange wood.
    - Metals: small brass accents only.

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.
    - Styling should feel airy and uncluttered in both day and night lighting.

    MUST PRESERVE:
    - Existing couch, floors, openings, fireplace, window and door positions.
    - Vent left of fireplace remains visible.
