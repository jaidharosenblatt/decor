    WALL TREATMENT - VARIATION {variation_index + 1}:
    {wall_treatment}
    
    FURNITURE COLOR - VARIATION {variation_index + 1}:
    Use {furniture_color} for wooden furniture pieces
    
    RUG STYLE - VARIATION {variation_index + 1}:
    {rug_style}
    
    {NEGATIVE_PROMPTS}
    
    {CAMERA_PROMPT}
    
    DESIGN STYLE - WARM + COOL BALANCE:
    - Mix warm leathers/wood (tan chairs, walnut cabinets, natural textures) with cool neutrals (grey couches, white walls)
    - This keeps the space from feeling cold or sterile
    
    MID-CENTURY MODERN INFLUENCE:
    - Clean lines, low-slung furniture
    - Accent chairs with wooden arms
    - Geometric rugs
    - Occasional retro vibes
    
    CURATED COMFORT:
    - Shelving with objects/art styled but not cluttered
    - Rugs that ground the space and add warmth without overpowering
    - Natural materials (wood, woven, linen, wool)
    
    LIGHT & CONTRAST PLAY:
    - White walls + dark floors = bold backdrop
    - Break this up with warm wood cabinetry, built-ins, or furniture
    
    MIX OF MODERN & CLASSIC:
    - Transitional balance â€” not one strict style
    - Some rooms lean modern (sleek fireplace, built-in shelving)
    - Others have hint of traditional (brass framed mirrors, patterned rugs)
    
    MUST PRESERVE EXACTLY:
    - Existing grey leather couch (do not change or replace)
    - Existing floors (do not change or replace)
    - Room dimensions and proportions (do not make room bigger or smaller)
    - All architectural features and room layout
    - Couch positioning facing projector
    
    HANDLE ASYMMETRY:
    - Room is asymmetrical - respect the uneven layout
    - Left side: 55.5 inches, Right side: different measurements
    - Sliding door sides: 46.5 inches each (symmetrical)
    - Fireplace area: 55 inches to staircase, 38 inches to light
    - Do not force symmetry - work with the natural asymmetrical layout
    - Furniture placement should respect the uneven room proportions
    - Wall treatments should balance the asymmetry without forcing perfect symmetry
    
    VARIATION FOCUS - WALL FURNITURE:
    Vary the furniture on the walls based on:
    - Material: wood, metal, glass, woven, ceramic
    - Furniture type: plants, side tables, lamps, bookshelves, artwork, mirrors, decorative objects
    - Style: mid-century modern, contemporary, vintage, eclectic
    - Color: warm woods, cool metals, natural textures, bold accents
    
    Generate a photorealistic interior design that shows proper furniture placement, accurate lighting, textures, and realistic perspective while maintaining the exact room dimensions and proportions.
