    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Keep existing couch facing the projector.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - Left bay depth 9.75in max
    - Right side furniture 18in max depth
    - 55.5in left bay width
    - 55in to staircase on right, 38in to sconce
    - 106in back sofa wall, 168in sliding door wall

    WALL TREATMENT
    {wall_treatment}

    LIGHTING & TIME OF DAY:
    {lighting}

    FURNITURE:

    Rug:
    Mid century modern rug

    On the left wall, a tall thin mid century modern lamp sits right next to the sliding door.

    Couch:
    - existing grey leather couch facing the projector all the way back of the wall. the back half of the couch should be off of the rug.

    Fireplace wall:
    Left bay (left of fireplace):
    2 side by side bookshelves (use bookshelf.png) image twice. They are 75in H X 26in W X 15in D each. so in total they are 75 in (70% of the wall) and 52in (2 inch on each side)
    
    Right bay (right of fireplace):
    Short hutch with a round mirror hung above it on the wall

    Accent chair:
     brown leather accent chair placed to the right of the couch on the rug facing the sliding door
   
    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - Do not show the projector screen; keep it retracted.
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.

    FURNITURE PLACEMENT:
    - Keep furniture within depth limits (left â‰¤9.75in, right â‰¤18in)

    {NEGATIVE_PROMPTS}
    {CAMERA_PROMPT}

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.

    MUST PRESERVE:
    - Existing couch, floors, openings, fireplace, window and door positions.
    - Vent left of fireplace remains visible.
