    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Same focal length and vantage as source. No wide angle exaggeration.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - 122 in back wall window 
    - 108 in wall parallel with kitchen, opposite from door
    - 72in wall next to door

    WALL TREATMENT:
    {wall_treatment}

    FURNITURE:


    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.

    MATERIAL AND COLOR RULES:
    - Walls: soft warm gray or off-white, matte (unless accent wall specified).

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.
