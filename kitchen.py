    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Same focal length and vantage as source. No wide angle exaggeration.
    - Change the color of the walls to be entirely white. Do NOT use the current green walls.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - 122 in back wall window 
    - 108 in wall parallel with kitchen, opposite from door
    - 72in wall next to door

    WALL TREATMENT:

    {wall_treatment}

    FURNITURE:
    {dining_table}

    {dining_room_extra}

    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Mid century modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.

    NEVER
    - Make any structural changes to the kitchen.
