CRITICAL PAINT AND LIGHTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the EXACT color from the paint CARDS (the small swatches), NOT the washed-out wall samples
- Match the SATURATED, RICH appearance of the paint cards themselves
- LIGHTING: The accent wall receives INDIRECT, WARM ambient lighting (not direct daylight)
- Colors must appear RICH and VIBRANT like they do on the fireplace wall in the reference image
- AVOID the pale, washed-out appearance seen on the left wall in the reference (that's from direct sunlight)
- Use warm 3000K lighting on accent surfaces to show full color depth and vibrancy
- Accent wall color must EXTEND FULLY into the staircase wall plane (no sharp cutoff)
- Fireplace bump-out must be the SAME COLOR as the surrounding accent (no white stripe)
- CRITICAL: All other walls (left wall with sliding door, right wall, etc.) must remain BRIGHT WHITE
- Accent colors should match the DEPTH and RICHNESS as shown on the paint swatches themselves

    IMAGE REFERENCES:
    - Room layout images: Use for current room geometry and layout (DO NOT ALTER)

    - Rug image (3. rug.png): Traditional red/burgundy ornate area rug to be placed in the room
    - Floating shelves image: Shelves for the left fireplace bay
    - Couch image: Existing grey leather couch to keep in place

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the current room images as a reference for the layout of the room. DO NOT ALTER THE LAYOUT.
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Keep existing couch facing the projector. Show only the front half of the couch.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - Left bay depth 9.75in max
    - Right side furniture 18in max depth
    - 55.5in left bay width
    - 55in to staircase on right, 38in to sconce
    - 106in back sofa wall, 168in sliding door wall

    WALL TREATMENT
    {wall_treatment}

    LIGHTING & TIME OF DAY:
    {lighting}

    FURNITURE:

    Rug: CRITICAL - Use the traditional red/burgundy ornate rug from the rug image (3. rug.png) - NOT any other rug

    On the left wall, a tall thin mid century modern lamp. Lamp is 12 inches from the sliding door.

    Couch:
    - existing grey leather couch facing the projector
    - CRITICAL: the back of the couch is FLUSH AGAINST the accent wall with NO GAP
    - the couch back is completely touching the wall, pushed all the way back
    - back legs of couch are off of the rug

    Fireplace wall:
    Left bay (left of fireplace):
    6 Floating shelves (use provided shelves image) 8in deep, 48 in wide (leave 10 inch gap on each side) Filled with green plants, mid century decor, and minimalistic books.

    Right bay (right of fireplace):
    Short hutch positioned DIRECTLY next to the fireplace wall (not centered in bay, but close to fireplace) with a round mirror hung above it on the wall

    Accent chairs:
    CRITICAL CHAIR POSITIONING - READ CAREFULLY:
    - 2 matching brown fabric swivel accent chairs positioned on EACH SIDE of the couch
    - ORIENTATION: Each chair must be turned 45 DEGREES INWARD toward the CENTER of the couch
    - Chairs should create a CONVERSATION CIRCLE with the couch, NOT face the fireplace/projector
    - Think "chairs facing each other across the couch" not "all furniture facing the TV"
    - The goal is INTIMATE CONVERSATION SEATING, not media viewing alignment
    - Position: Adequate spacing from couch (NOT pinned against couch)
   
    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - Do not show the projector screen; keep it retracted.
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.

    FURNITURE PLACEMENT:
    - Keep furniture within depth limits (left ‚â§9.75in, right ‚â§18in)

    {NEGATIVE_PROMPTS}
    {CAMERA_PROMPT}

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.

    MUST PRESERVE:
    - Existing couch, floors, openings, fireplace, window and door positions.
    - Vent left of fireplace remains visible.
