    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use the current room images (first images) as a reference for the layout of the room. DO NOT ALTER THE LAYOUT.
    - Use the exact room geometry and the measurements listed below. Do not alter architecture.
    - Keep existing couch facing the projector. Show only the front half of the couch.

    EXACT ROOM DIMENSIONS:
    - Left bay depth 9.75in max
    - Right side furniture 18in max depth
    - 55.5in left bay width
    - 55in to staircase on right, 38in to sconce
    - 106in back sofa wall, 168in sliding door wall

    WALL TREATMENT
    {wall_treatment}

    LIGHTING & TIME OF DAY:
    {lighting}

    FURNITURE:

    Rug: Use the provided rug image from the item images

    On the left wall, a tall thin mid century modern lamp. Lamp is 12 inches from the sliding door.

    Couch:
    - existing grey leather couch facing the projector
    - the back half of the couch is touching the wall
    - back legs of couch are off of the rug

    Fireplace wall:
    Left bay (left of fireplace):
    6 Floating shelves (use provided shelves image) 8in deep, 48 in wide (leave 10 inch gap on each side) Filled with green plants, mid century decor, and minimalistic books.
    
    Right bay (right of fireplace):
    Short hutch with a round mirror hung above it on the wall

    Accent chairs:
    2 matching brown fabric accent chairs. 1 on each side of the couch. each is angled facing the couch at a 45 degree angle.
   
    PHOTO BEHAVIOR:
    - Do not show the projector screen; keep it retracted.
    - No flash. Use naturalistic interior lighting and accurate exposure.

    FURNITURE PLACEMENT:
    - Keep furniture within depth limits (left â‰¤9.75in, right â‰¤18in)

    {CAMERA_PROMPT}

    DESIGN INTENT:
    - Quiet, modern, and elevated. Subtle detail over bold patterns.
    - Prioritize negative space. Avoid visual heaviness.

    MUST PRESERVE:
    - Existing couch, floors, openings, fireplace, window and door positions.
    - Vent left of fireplace remains visible.
